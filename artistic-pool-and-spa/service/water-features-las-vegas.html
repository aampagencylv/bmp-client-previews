          <!-- Intro -->
          <div class="content-section">
            <p>A pool is great. A pool with a cascading rock waterfall, a swim-up bar, and fire bowls glowing at sunset? That's a backyard people never want to leave.</p>
            <p>At Artistic Pool & Spa, water features are where we truly shine. Since 1981, we've designed and hand-built hundreds of custom water features across the Las Vegas Valley — from dramatic multi-tier rock waterfalls to sleek modern sheer descents. Every feature is engineered for reliability, designed for visual impact, and built to handle the Las Vegas climate.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Types of Water Features -->
          <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Water Features We Design & Build</h2>

            <h3>Rock Waterfalls & Grottos</h3>
            <p>Our signature offering. We sculpt natural boulder waterfalls that look like they've been there for centuries — with hidden grottos, swim-throughs, and seating areas carved into the rock. Each waterfall is custom-built on-site using hand-selected boulders, not prefab artificial rock.</p>

            <h3>Swim-Up Bars</h3>
            <p>The ultimate Las Vegas pool feature. Our swim-up bars include submerged seating, a countertop at water level, and can be integrated with an outdoor kitchen behind the bar. We handle the plumbing, electrical for blenders and refrigeration, and drainage — everything you need to serve drinks poolside without leaving the water.</p>

            <h3>Water Slides</h3>
            <p>Custom-built slides that integrate seamlessly with your pool's landscape — not the bolted-on plastic kind. From gentle children's slides built into rock formations to thrilling multi-turn slides for the adventurous, we engineer every slide for safety and fun.</p>

            <h3>Sheer Descents & Scuppers</h3>
            <p>For a more modern aesthetic, sheer descent waterfalls create a smooth, glass-like sheet of water flowing from a raised wall. Scuppers — individual water streams from raised walls or columns — add elegant movement and sound. Both are stunning when paired with LED lighting.</p>

            <h3>Fire & Water Bowls</h3>
            <p>Nothing says Las Vegas luxury like fire dancing over water. Our fire bowls sit on raised pedestals at pool's edge, with water cascading from the bowl into the pool while gas-fed flames glow above. The effect at night is extraordinary.</p>

            <h3>Laminar Jets & Deck Jets</h3>
            <p>Arcing streams of clear water that launch from the deck into the pool — and can be lit with fiber optic color-changing LEDs for a spectacular nighttime display. Kids love running through them; adults love the ambiance.</p>

            <h3>Rain Curtains & Rain Walls</h3>
            <p>A curtain of water falling from a horizontal beam — perfect for creating a dramatic entry to a spa area or separating zones within your pool environment.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Adding to Existing Pools -->
          <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Adding Water Features to an Existing Pool</h2>
            <p>You don't need a new pool to enjoy water features. Many of our projects involve retrofitting waterfalls, fire bowls, deck jets, and other features into existing pools. Our team evaluates your pool's current plumbing, electrical, and structural capacity to determine what's possible — and you'd be surprised how much is possible.</p>
            <p>Common retrofit features include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rock waterfall additions built on the pool's edge or raised bond beam</li>
              <li>Sheer descent or scupper installations on existing raised walls</li>
              <li>Fire bowl installation on existing pedestals or new builds</li>
              <li>Deck jet systems installed into existing concrete decking</li>
              <li>Laminar jet systems with LED color integration</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Why Water Features Matter -->
          <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Why Water Features Transform Your Pool</h2>
            <p>Beyond the obvious "wow factor," water features deliver real benefits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sound masking</strong> — The gentle sound of flowing water creates a peaceful atmosphere and masks neighborhood noise</li>
              <li><strong>Water circulation</strong> — Moving water helps distribute chemicals more evenly and discourages algae growth</li>
              <li><strong>Home value</strong> — Pools with water features consistently appraise higher than basic pools</li>
              <li><strong>Entertainment value</strong> — Swim-up bars, slides, and grottos turn your pool from "nice" to "legendary" for hosting</li>
              <li><strong>Night aesthetics</strong> — When paired with LED lighting, water features become stunning visual showpieces after dark</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- FAQ -->
          <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Water Features FAQ</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much do pool water features cost?</h3>
                <p>Costs vary significantly based on the type and complexity. Deck jets start around $1,500–$3,000. Sheer descents run $3,000–$8,000. Rock waterfalls range from $10,000 for a simple design to $50,000+ for a large multi-tier waterfall with grotto. Swim-up bars start around $15,000. We provide detailed estimates for every project.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I add a waterfall to my existing pool?</h3>
                <p>In most cases, yes. We evaluate your pool's structure, plumbing capacity, and equipment to determine feasibility. We've added waterfalls to pools over 30 years old. The key is proper engineering — which is where our 40+ years of experience pays off.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are water features expensive to operate?</h3>
                <p>Not with modern equipment. We use variable-speed pumps that adjust flow rates, and most features can run on timers. A typical waterfall costs $15–$30 per month to operate. Fire features run on natural gas and cost roughly the same. We design every system for efficiency.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do water features require special maintenance?</h3>
                <p>Very little beyond normal pool maintenance. Rock waterfalls may need occasional cleaning to prevent mineral buildup (common in Las Vegas's hard water). We teach you everything during the final walkthrough and are always available for questions.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you build a waterfall that looks natural?</h3>
                <p>That's our specialty. We use hand-selected natural boulders — not fake molded rock — and our masons sculpt each waterfall on-site. The result looks like nature put it there. We often incorporate native desert plants and materials to blend the feature into the Las Vegas landscape.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long does it take to install water features?</h3>
                <p>Simple features like deck jets take 2–3 days. A full rock waterfall takes 1–3 weeks depending on size. Swim-up bars typically take 2–4 weeks. If we're building features as part of a new pool, they're integrated into the construction timeline at no additional time cost.</p>
