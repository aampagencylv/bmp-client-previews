            <h2>Summerlin's Preferred Custom Pool Builder</h2>
            <p>Summerlin is one of the most desirable communities in the Las Vegas Valley — and Summerlin homeowners expect the best. That's why so many families in The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, Tournament Hills, and Summerlin Centre turn to Artistic Pool & Spa when it's time to build or remodel their pool.</p>
            <p>Our office on West Flamingo Road is just minutes from Summerlin, and we've been building pools in the community since its earliest residential villages. We understand Summerlin's unique HOA landscape, its premium lot configurations, and the elevated aesthetic expectations of homeowners who choose to live in one of America's best master-planned communities.</p>
            <p>Unlike cookie-cutter pool companies that recycle the same design across dozens of yards, every Artistic Pool & Spa project is designed from scratch — a custom creation that's as unique as the Summerlin home it complements.</p>

            <h2>Pool Services Available in Summerlin</h2>

            <h3>Custom Pool Construction</h3>
            <p>Summerlin's larger lot sizes and premium home values make it ideal for resort-style pools with all the trimmings. We design and build custom pools with integrated spas, infinity edges, tanning ledges, swim-up bars, and complete outdoor living environments. Our 3D design process lets you visualize your pool in your actual backyard before we break ground. <a href="../service/custom-pool-construction-las-vegas.html">Learn more →</a></p>

            <h3>Pool Remodeling</h3>
            <p>Summerlin's earlier villages — including The Hills, The Willows, and The Trails — have pools that are now 20–30 years old. We transform these dated pools with modern finishes, updated tile and coping, LED lighting, energy-efficient equipment, and new features like waterfalls and fire bowls. <a href="../service/pool-remodeling-las-vegas.html">See remodeling options →</a></p>

            <h3>Water Features</h3>
            <p>Summerlin backyards demand showstopping features. Our custom rock waterfalls, grottos, sheer descents, and fire-and-water combinations create a private resort atmosphere that matches the quality of your home. <a href="../service/water-features-las-vegas.html">Explore water features →</a></p>

            <h3>Outdoor Living Spaces</h3>
            <p>We design complete backyard environments that integrate your pool with outdoor kitchens, fire pits, pergolas, and hardscaping. In Summerlin's climate, an outdoor living space effectively doubles your home's entertaining area for most of the year.</p>

            <h2>Summerlin Pool Builder FAQs</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you work with Summerlin HOAs?</h3>
                <p>Extensively. Summerlin has some of the most detailed HOA requirements in the valley, especially in guard-gated communities like The Ridges and Red Rock Country Club. We prepare all required documentation — including detailed site plans, elevation drawings, materials specifications, and color samples — and handle the submission and follow-up process entirely.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the typical pool cost in Summerlin?</h3>
                <p>Summerlin pools tend to run slightly higher than valley-wide averages due to larger sizes and premium materials that match the homes. Custom pool construction typically ranges from $65,000–$175,000+ depending on size and features. Remodeling projects range from $15,000–$80,000+. We provide detailed, transparent estimates.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you build on Summerlin's hillside lots?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Communities like The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, and Stonebridge feature elevated lots with slopes and views. We have extensive experience with hillside pool engineering, including retaining walls, infinity edges, and elevated decking. These projects require specialized expertise — which is exactly what 40+ years provides.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long does it take to build a pool in Summerlin?</h3>
                <p>Plan for 10–16 weeks from groundbreaking to swim day. Summerlin HOA approval typically adds 2–4 weeks at the beginning. More complex designs with extensive water features and outdoor living elements may take longer. We provide a detailed timeline in your proposal.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you offer pool-and-landscape packages?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Many Summerlin homeowners want a complete backyard transformation. We coordinate pool construction with landscaping, outdoor kitchens, fire features, and hardscaping for a cohesive, unified design — versus piecing together multiple contractors with different visions.</p>

                <blockquote>"Our pool was 20 years old and looked it. Artistic Pool completely transformed it — new pebble finish, updated tile, LED lighting, and added a gorgeous waterfall we didn't even know was possible. Our neighbors can't stop asking who did the work."</blockquote>

                <blockquote>"We chose Artistic over two bigger companies because Wade actually came to our house and spent an hour understanding what we wanted. The other companies sent salespeople with tablets and pre-made designs. Our pool in Tournament Hills is absolutely stunning — completely unique, exactly what we envisioned."</blockquote>
