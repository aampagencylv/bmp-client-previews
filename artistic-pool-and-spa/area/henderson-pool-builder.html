            <h2>Custom Pool Builder for Henderson, Nevada</h2>
            <p>Henderson homeowners know the value of a great backyard. With over 300 days of sunshine a year and some of Southern Nevada's most beautiful master-planned communities, Henderson is one of the best places in the country to invest in a custom pool.</p>
            <p>Artistic Pool & Spa has been building pools for Henderson families since the city's first major residential boom in the 1990s. From the established neighborhoods of Green Valley to the luxury estates of Anthem Country Club, Lake Las Vegas, and MacDonald Highlands — we've built and remodeled hundreds of pools across every Henderson community.</p>
            <p>As a family-owned builder based just minutes away on West Flamingo Road, we treat Henderson as an extension of our home turf. Our team knows Henderson's HOA requirements, soil conditions, and lot configurations inside and out.</p>

            <h2>Pool & Spa Services in Henderson</h2>

            <h3>Custom Pool Construction</h3>
            <p>Whether you're building on a flat Green Valley lot or navigating the slopes of MacDonald Highlands, our team designs and constructs pools that fit your property perfectly. Henderson homes often feature larger lots than central Las Vegas, giving us room to create resort-style layouts with integrated spas, water features, and outdoor living spaces. <a href="../service/custom-pool-construction-las-vegas.html">Learn more about our custom pool construction →</a></p>

            <h3>Pool Remodeling & Renovation</h3>
            <p>Many Henderson pools were built in the 1990s and early 2000s — meaning they're due for an upgrade. We specialize in transforming dated pools with new pebble finishes, updated tile, modern LED lighting, and energy-efficient equipment that can cut your operating costs by 50% or more. <a href="../service/pool-remodeling-las-vegas.html">See our pool remodeling services →</a></p>

            <h3>Water Features & Enhancements</h3>
            <p>Add the "wow factor" to your Henderson pool with custom waterfalls, swim-up bars, fire bowls, deck jets, or sheer descents. We design every feature to complement your existing pool and landscape — whether you're building new or retrofitting an existing pool. <a href="../service/water-features-las-vegas.html">Explore water feature options →</a></p>

            <h3>Spa Construction</h3>
            <p>A custom spa is the perfect complement to Henderson's outdoor lifestyle. We build attached pool-and-spa combinations with spillover designs, as well as standalone spas for homeowners who want a dedicated relaxation space without a full pool build.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you handle Henderson HOA pool approvals?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We've worked with virtually every HOA in Henderson and know exactly what documentation they require. We prepare and submit all plans, site drawings, and elevation documents on your behalf. Most Henderson HOA approvals take 2–4 weeks, and we factor that into our project timeline.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How is building a pool in Henderson different from Las Vegas?</h3>
                <p>Henderson lots tend to be larger, which opens up design possibilities. However, some Henderson neighborhoods — especially those near the foothills — have rocky, sloped terrain that requires specialized excavation. Our 40+ years of local experience means we know exactly how to handle these conditions efficiently.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you service Lake Las Vegas and MacDonald Highlands?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. We have extensive experience building luxury pools in both communities. These high-end properties often involve complex designs with infinity edges, hillside engineering, and premium materials — exactly the kind of project our team excels at.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you remodel my Green Valley pool from the '90s?</h3>
                <p>That's one of our most common projects! Green Valley has thousands of pools from the 1990s that are due for resurfacing, new tile, updated equipment, and modern features. We can transform a 25-year-old pool into something that looks brand new — often in just 2–4 weeks.</p>
              </div>

                <h3>How do I get started with a Henderson pool project?</h3>
                <p>Call us at (702) 870-6760 or fill out our contact form. We'll schedule a free on-site consultation at your Henderson home, discuss your vision, take measurements, and provide a detailed estimate — all at no cost and with no obligation.</p>

Wade came out personally, took measurements, and the 3D rendering blew us away. The finished pool looks even better than the design. Worth every penny."</blockquote>
